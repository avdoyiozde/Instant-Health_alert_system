# Healthcare Monitoring Data Pipeline

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a real-time data pipeline solution for healthcare monitoring, aimed at capturing and analyzing the streaming vital data from IoT devices in hospitals and healthcare centers. The solution will monitor patient data such as body temperature, heartbeat, blood pressure, and other vital signs in real-time. If any data exceeds predefined threshold limits, a real-time alert notification will be sent to the registered email ID.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Apache Kafka**: Used for capturing and ingesting real-time streaming data from IoT devices.
- **Apache Sqoop**: For batch data ingestion (e.g., patient contact information) from relational databases to Hadoop.
- **Apache PySpark**: For processing and analyzing both streaming and batch data.
- **Hive**: Data warehousing solution for storing processed data.
- **HBase**: NoSQL database for storing real-time patient data.
- **Email Notification System**: To send real-time alerts when patient vital signs exceed predefined thresholds.

## Project Requirements

1. **Real-time Data Ingestion**:

   - Streaming data (patient's vital information) will be ingested via Apache Kafka.
   - Batch data (patient contact information) will be ingested via Apache Sqoop.

2. **Data Processing**:

   - The streaming data will be processed using Apache PySpark to calculate and compare the vital information against threshold limits.
   - Historical and batch data will be stored in HBase and Hive for further analysis.

3. **Threshold Comparison**:

   - Vital information (e.g., temperature, heartbeat, BP) will be compared to predefined threshold values.
   - If any value exceeds the normal range, an alert notification will be triggered.

4. **Alert Notification System**:
   - The system will automatically send an email notification when patient vital signs exceed threshold limits, ensuring timely interventions.

```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

- Clone this repository.
- Install required Python packages using `pip`:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### 2. Kafka Setup

- Set up Kafka brokers and configure topics for streaming data.
- Modify the `kafka_config.txt` file to match your Kafka setup.

### 3. HBase & Hive Setup

- Set up HBase and Hive to store real-time and batch data.
- Configure the connection details in the corresponding Python scripts.

### 4. Running the Scripts

- **Start Kafka producers** to simulate the streaming of vital data.
- **Run the streaming data processor**:
  ```bash
  python kafka_produce_patient_vitals.py
  ```
- **Run the batch data processor** to ingest patient contact information:
  ```bash
  spark-submit --packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.11:2.4.5 kafka_spark_patient_vitals.py
  ```
- **Run the alert notification script** to monitor and send alerts:
  ```bash
  spark-submit --packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.11:2.4.5 kafka_spark_generate_alerts.py
  ```
- **Consume the alert notification script** to monitor and send alerts:
  ```bash
  spark-submit --executor-memory 4G --num-executors 4 --packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.11:2.4.5 kafka_spark_generate_alerts.py
  ```

### 5. Real-time Alerts

- If any patient's vital sign exceeds the threshold (e.g., heart rate > 100 bpm), an email will be sent to the registered email ID.
